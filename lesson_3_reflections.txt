When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Working with other people. Moving between computers. Backups. etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Want to know when to expect changes, review what's come in.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a clone that github does within their server for you, for modifying your own versions. Links back to original repo. Clone is copying one repo from some location (local or remote) to another location. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    As a reference point for when pulling/fetching new changes on the remote. Also so you can fetch the remote changes without needing to merge immediately, allowing you to work on rewsolving conflicts offline later.
